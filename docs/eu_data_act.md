# EU Data Act

Date: 3-sep-2024

**Goal**: seeks to harmonize the access to and use of data within the EU.



> The Data Act is a comprehensive initiative to address the challenges and unleash the opportunities presented by data in the European Union, emphasizing fair access and user rights, while ensuring the protection of personal data. (Ref. [data-act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-act))



> The [Data Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2854/oj) is a law designed to enhance the EU’s data economy and **foster a competitive data** market by making data (in particular industrial data) more accessible and usable, encouraging data-driven innovation and **increasing data availabilit**y. To achieve this, the Data Act ensures fairness in the allocation of the value of data amongst the actors in the data economy. It clarifies *who* can use *what* data and under *which* conditions.



## Stockholders:

- **user**: natural or legal person that owns, rents or leases an IoT product or receives a related service.
- **data holder**: Natural or legal person which holds data and can enable access to data.
- **data recipient**: natural or legal person, receiving data from data holder at user's request.
- **data coordinator: national competent authority**: act as a ‘one-stop shop’ for all issues related to the implementation of the Data Act at the national level, facilitating is application both for businesses and public authorities.

**Example**: car users grant permission to insurance companies for data generated by using a car. Based on these, an insurance firm might incentivize safe driving by providing discounts to policyholders.

## Chapter II: Business-to-business and business-to-consumer data sharing in the context of the IoT market

#### Data in Scope

**Type of data**: **all raw and pre-processed data generated from the use of a connected product or a related service that is readily available to the data holder** (e.g. manufacturer of a connected product/ provider of a related service)

Note: the Data Act is without prejudice to the laws on the protection of [intellectual property rights](https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/doing-business-eu/intellectual-property-rights_en).

#### In practice:

- allows **users** (i.e. any legal or natural person who owns, rents or leases a connected product) **to access the data** that they generate through their use of the connected product or related service.
- The **data holder** is typically the company that makes the connected product or that provides a related service.
- It is important to note that the **data holder cannot** use any non-personal data generated by the product **without the user’s agreement**.
- data holders must make the data available to users **for free**.
- The Data Act is fully **compliant with data protection rules**, notably the GDPR.

#### *Limitations on the use of the data*

- the data obtained cannot be used to develop a **competing connected product**.
- The Data Act **does not prohibit** competition in **related** or **aftermarket services**.
- To protect **trade secrets** without undermining the goal of the Data Act to make more data available, the data holder and the user/ third party may agree on certain measures to preserve the confidentiality of the trade secrets
  - The data holder **may only refuse to share data** where it can demonstrate that it is highly likely to **suffer serious economic damage** from the disclosure of **trade secrets**.



## Chapter III: Rules on mandatory business-to-business data sharing

#### Data in Scope

Applies to **all data** (both personal and non-personal) held by a business, including situations covered in Chapter II of the Data Act.

#### In practice:

- Data holders may request **reasonable compensation** for making the data available to a data recipient.



## Chapter IV: Unfair contractual terms

Aims to protect all European businesses seeking to acquire data, in particular SMEs, against unfair contractual terms through its measures to intervene in situations where, for example, one of the businesses is in a stronger bargaining position.

#### Data in Scope

All data, both personal and non-personal, held by a private entity that is accessed and used based on a contract between businesses.



## Chapter VI: Switching between data processing services

Customers of data processing services (including cloud and edge services) should be able to switch seamlessly from one provider to another. 

The Data Act will make switching free, fast and fluid.

#### In practice:

- sets **minimum requirements for the content of cloud contracts**.
- customers **can switch** from one provider of data processing services (‘source provider’) to another (‘destination’) provider quickly and smoothly, and without losing any data or the functionality of applications.
- Platform and Software as a Service must **make open interfaces available** and, at a minimum, export data in a commonly used and **machine-readable format**.
- The Data Act will also **entirely remove switching charges**, including charges for data egress (i.e. charges for data transit), from 12 January 2027.
