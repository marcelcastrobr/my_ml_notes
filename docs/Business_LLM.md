## AWS Application Examples



### Glue - Generative Data Integration

**Broadcast**: [Generative Data Integration (AWS Glue](https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/1066838?ref=personal)) 

**What it is**: Glue Data integration as part of Amazon Q. Give an idea of challenges the Glue team had from proof-of-concept to productionizing Generative AI. Thus highly relevant in connection to our **[2024 AGS Tech Goal / G1: Innovation Through GenAI](https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/AGSTECH/Goals2024/GenAI)**.

**Shortcuts**: AWS Glue Journey (0:17:37), Challenges (0:52:00)

**TL;DW:** 

- Need for high quality data integration dataset.
- RAG challenges: Kendra versus OpenSearch
- Production consideration: guardrails (security and prompt injection) and PII detection
- hack != Product -> this might reflect our challenge to help customer on productioning Generative AI in 2024.
- Domain knowledge: *otherwise LLMs and halucination go hand in hand*.
- custom metrics (?): enable product improvement without customer interaction data.
